## Quick Start

```bash
# Backend
cd server && npm install && npm run dev

# Frontend (main app)
cd client && npm install && npm run dev

# Simulation pages (static, open directly in browser)
open simulation/amazon.html
```

Create `server/.env`:
```
SARVAM_API_KEY=your-key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key
PORT=5000
```

> Simulation pages post reviews to `http://localhost:5000/api/reviews/ingest`. Main app frontend connects to the same backend.
